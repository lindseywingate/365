S230	20 points	Due: April 8

Write a program that uses an array-based linked
list to manage a cell phone "circle of friends."

Your program must be able to manage 10 different
friends (ie you will need a directory that can hold
the first and last names and starting block for 10
entries). So you can make this a static array of 
structs.

Your linked list must be able to hold the phone 
numbers (7 digits minimum) and the "next" block 
"pointer." Also, your linked list must be able to 
hold 50 phone numbers (in total). So you can make 
this a static array of structs also.

You must assume that each friend can have more than
one phone, thus a linked list will form. You may 
need a dynamic array to temporarily hold these
numbers.

Your program must read the data from a file (hw8data.txt)
that has the following format:

x firstname lastname N phone_number [phone-number] ...

1) The 'x' will be I or R. 'I' indicates that you should
   add this person to your system (if they don't already 
   exist). 'R' indicates that you should remove this 
   person from your system. Also, with 'R' N will have 
   the value 0 (you will have to process the linked list 
   to find & remove the numbers). 

   The 'x' may also be a Q. This is a flag to quit/exit
   the program.

   You MUST have a separate function that adds names to 
   your list.

   You MUST have a separate function that removes names
   from your list.

   You may use global structures, but other variables 
   can be globals.

2) firstname will be a string containing their first name.
   since you are dealing with strings, you will want to
   use strcpy() and strcmp().

3) lastname will be a string containing their last name.

4) N will be an integer telling you how many phone
   numbers this person will have allocated to them. Since
   any person can have more than one phone number a linked
   list can form.

5) The list of 7 digit phone numbers. The number of phone 
   numbers will match the value of N (N will start at 1).

After you have processed the input data file. You MUST 
print the contents of the linked list (not the directory) 
to the screen.

Example input file:

I Herb Thompson 1 7728323
I Angela Urness 3 7809606 7733889 7724609
I Josh Vanpelt 2 7721170 7731959
