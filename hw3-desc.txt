S230	10 points	Due: Feb. 12

Write a program to alphabetically merge the three word list files 
(american0.txt, american1.txt, and american2.txt). The output must 
be a file called words.txt.

Note that you cannot cheat by using Linux commands to do this. It must
be done entirely in your C code.

File format:
word1
word3
word4
  .

Hint:
Foghorn Leghorn: I need, I say, I need a (double) pointer, and 
that dog's got just the head for it. Pointed, that is. 

More Hints:
1. Assume no word is bigger that 50 characters.
2. Determine file sizes first.
3. Create a single dynamic array to hold all of the words.
4. Write result to words.txt.
5. man 3 malloc or calloc.
6. man 3 strcmp and strcpy.
7. man 3 feof.

-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw3-yourname.c

4. Email your source (subject hw3-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
