S230	10 points	Due: March 25

On this date in 1669, Mount Etna in Sicily erupted 
destroying the city of Nicolosi. 20,000 people were 
killed. Scientists say that if the students had just 
done their homework that many live could have been 
saved.


Write a program that builds a doubly linked 
linked-list and populate the linked list with 
the integers 0 through N (where N is a command 
line argument, see 
http://gd.tuwien.ac.at/languages/c/programming-bbrown/c_105.htm). 
Note that you must trap cases where you have
no command line arguments and where you have too
many command line arguments. It is OK in both of
these cases to print an error message and exit
the program.

Your program must display the value of N (formatted 
as shown below - tab seperated) followed by a blank 
line. You may also want to "man 3 atoi()".

As you populate the list, print out the values
being inserted (formatted as shown below - tab 
seperated), followed by a blank line.

Once the list is populated, print out the 
contents from left to right, then print out a 
blank line, then print out the contents from 
right to left.

The inputs (data or payload) will simply come from 
a for loop (0 to N), in that order! Here is what 
your output MUST look like (except N will vary).

Command line argument:	3

Input data:		0
Input data:		1
Input data:		2
Input data:		3

Left to right output:	0
Left to right output:	1
Left to right output:	2
Left to right output:	3

Right to left output:	3
Right to left output:	2
Right to left output:	1
Right to left output:	0

Finally, pictorally, the linked list should look 
like this:

Head -> |---| -> |---| -> NULL
        | 0 |    | 1 |
NULL <- |___| <- |___| <- Tail

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw6-yourname.c

4. Email your source (subject hw6-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
