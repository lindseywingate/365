S230	20 points	Due: Jan. 29

Part 1:
-------
Write a program that provides the user with a simple 
menu that includes the following options:
 1. Sort data by the float value & print high to low
 2. Sort data by the float value & print low to high
 3. Sort data by the int value & print high to low
 4. Sort data by the int value & print low to high
 5. Exit

Of course, the menu must repeatedly be displayed until 
the user selects the "exit" option. You will need an 
infinite loop to accomplish ths.

The only thing allowed in the main routine is the code
required to handle the menu and calls to functions to
read the data and sort it.

Part 2:
-------
For menu options 1, 2, 3 & 4 your program must call a 
function that opens a file of unknown size and stores 
the data in a array of struct***. The file will 
be called hw2.data. The file will contain a string, a 
float, an int and string. Below is a sample file:

   F150 5.4 28000 white
   RAM1500 5.7 32000 orange

The code to handle this MUST be a function separate from
the main routine.

*** You can assume that the file will contain no more than
100 entries.


Part 3:
-------
For menu options 1, 2, 3 & 4 your program must call a 
function that sorts the data HIGH TO LOW by the appropriate 
component. Since we are sorting the data by 2 different 
components you are allowed to have 2 different sort 
functions. But, ONLY 2!

Part 4:
-------
For menu options 1, 2, 3 & 4 your program must call a 
function that prints the resulting data. Since you must 
print the data high to low or low to high, you are allowed 
to have 2 routines. But, only 2!

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw2-yourname.c

3. Email your source (subject hw2-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
