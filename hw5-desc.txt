S230	10 points	Due: March 11

Write a program that uses a pointer-based linked
list. You should use the following struct (declared
as a global):

   struct node {
      int  data;
      struct node *next;
   };

Your program must use a for loop to count from 0 
to 9. Your program must insert these into a linked
list such that they can be retrieved in low-to-high 
order (note that the example in class retrieved in
high-to-low order).

Your program must display the results using the 
following code (from class) without any modifications:

   while (current) {
      printf("%d\n", current->data);
      current = current->next ;
   }


Next, your program must prompt the user for a value and 
call a linear search function to find that value. 
If the value is found, your program must print out
the value. You must use this code to print the value

    printf("[%d %d]\n", search, searchList(search, head)->data);
 
and this prototype for the search function:

    link *searchList(int value, link *head) 
 

Your program must also correctly free all links
of the list.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run in Streibel 115/109 or on shell.aero.und.edu.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw5-yourname.c

4. Email your source (subject hw5-yourname) to rmarsh@cs.und.edu
